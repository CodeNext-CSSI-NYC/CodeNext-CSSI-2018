  missedLetters is ["a", "b", "c", "d"], this function prints "Missed letters:

  Prints the string "Secret Word: ", along with whatever letters the player has
  guessed correctly, as a single string. The correct letters should appear where
  they normally do in the secret word. Letters the player has not yet guessed
  should appear as underscores ("blanks"). There should be a space between each
  letter or blank.

  For example, if the secret word is "google" and the player has guessed "o",
  this function prints "Correct letters: _ o o _ _ _".

/******************************************************************************
                                  getGuess()

  In an infinite loop, prompt the player to guess a letter. The program can exit
  the loop only if the player's guess is "valid", which means it passes all
  three of these conditions:
   1) The length of the guess must be exactly 1.
   2) The guess cannot be a letter they have already guessed (alreadyGuessed is
      an array passed into the function).
   3) The guess must be a letter in the English alphabet.

  Return the guess if it is valid. If a guess does not satisfy a condition,
  print a message communicating this to the player. For example, if the player
  enters "abc" or "", they have failed condition #1, so you should print
  something like, "Please guess one letter at a time.".

  Valid guesses should include both uppercase and lowercase letters. To make
  things easier on yourself, try setting the player's guess to all lowercase
  before validating it against the three conditions.

function getGuess(alreadyGuessed) {

}

/******************************************************************************
                                  processGuess()

  Get a player's guess by calling getGuess(). If the guess appears in the secret
  word, append that letter to correctLetters. Otherwise append it to
  missedLetters.

  Note that getGuess() has a parameter called alreadyGuessed, which prevents the
  player from guessing the same letter more than once. When calling getGuess(),
  you need to pass an array of guesses the user has already made, which is
  simply a concatenation of missedLetters and correctLetters arrays.

  You can concatenate arrays using the array.concat() method. For example:

  var array1 = ["a", "b", "c"];
  var array2 = ["d", "e", "f"];
  var array3 = array1.concat(array2);

  The value of array3 is ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"].

/******************************************************************************
                                  checkWinLose()

  Check if the player has won or lost, and call processGameOver() in either
  case. More details:
  -If they have won, print a congratulatory message, then call
   processGameOver().
  -Otherwise, if they have lost, print the board one last time. Then print a
   message telling them they have run out of guesses, along with another message
   telling them what the secret word was. Finally, call processGameOver().
  -If they have neither won nor lost, do nothing.

  To check for a win, you should see if each letter in the secretWord string is
  contained in the correctLetters array. You can do this with a for loop that
  passes through the length of secretWord, but exits the moment it finds a
  letter that isn't contained in correctLetters. This is the trickiest part of
  this project and requires you to think out of the box a bit (at least, if
  you want to do it the "neat" way).
