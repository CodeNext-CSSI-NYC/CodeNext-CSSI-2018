  This function calls the three functions above to convert an entire number (num)
  into word form, then returns that word. This function should be able to handle
  numbers from 0 to 9999 (inclusive).

  To do this, first declare a variable named wordForm at the top of the
  function. This will be the string you will return at the end of the function,
  so initialize it to an empty string at the start: let wordForm = "";

  Your first conditional statement should check if num is equal to 0. If so,
  set wordForm to the string "zero".

  Otherwise, build the word form of num by chopping num into thousands,
  hundreds, tens, and ones. Convert each place value number to a word by calling
  the three functions above, and concatenate each word with the wordForm variable.

  At the very end of your function it should simply return wordForm.

  Examples:
  sayNumber(0) → "zero"
  sayNumber(9999) → "nine-thousand nine-hundred ninety-nine"
  sayNumber(75) → "seventy-five"
