                                constant variables

  These are global variables that should stay the same throughout the run of the
  program. After being initialized, JavaScript won't let you change them ever
  again. Great for when you want to "protect" certain variables from accidental
  tampering!

                                global variables

board
String array. Represents the tic-tac-toe game board. A 3x3 grid. BLank squares
are represented by " - " strings.

turnsLeft
Number. The number of turns remaining. When this is 0, the game is declared a
draw. Since there are only 9 total moves players can make in one game, this
should be initialized to 9 at the start of every game.

activePlayer
Number. Represents the currently active player. Encoded as 0 for Player One and
1 for Player Two. Initialize this in setupGame() by "flipping a coin".

winner
String. Represents the current winner. By default this is "" or an empty
string. After each round of play, the game should check to see if someone has
won, in which case this variable will hold a value of "X" or "O".

quit
Boolean. Represents if the player has chosen to quit the game (true) or not
(false).

  should be accepted). If a player chooses a square that is not blank (" - "),
  they should be made to choose again, until they choose a blank square.

  (mind the spaces!). Then switch the active player to the other player.

  While turnsleft is greater than 0 and the winner variable is set to an
  empty string, do the following in an endless loop:
    1) Print the board.
    2) If the winner is "X", print "X wins!"
    3) Otherwise, if the winner is "O", print "O wins!".
    4) Otherwise, no one has won, so call chooseRowColumn() and decrement
       turnsLeft.

  Outside of the loop, check if turnsLeft is 0. If so, print the board, then
  print "DRAW!".

  Finally, the game is over at this point. So ask players if they would like to
  play again (just as you did in Nim). If they answer anything other than "yes"
  or "y" (or whatever else you want), set quit to true.
