// 1. Decrease the variable below by 1 using two different shortcuts.
// Print out its value after each step to make sure it worked.
let a = 7;

// 2. Double the value of the variable below using a multiplication shortcut.
// Print out its value before and after each step to make sure it worked.
let b = 18;

// Bonus: Can you think of a way to double the value of a variable using an addition shortcut? Hmm.... (Note: you would never do this, since readability of code is very important and this would be confusing.)

// 3. Predict the value of d. Then print it out to see if you were right.
let c = 13;
let d = c++;

// 4. Move the decimal two spots to the left using a shortcut.
// Print out the value of e before and after to make sure it worked.
let e = 234.5;
