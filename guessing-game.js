// This game has already been discussed in the notes on the site.
// Do not look back at those notes, that would ruin the learning.
// If you have not yet done so, run npm install random-int in terminal.
// Google "npm random-int" to see how it works.
// We will make a guessing game as follows:
// Set a random number from 1 to 100 to be the answer.
// Ask the user to guess a number.
// If they're wrong, you should ask them to guess again.
// Each time they guess, you should be telling them if their guess was too high or too low.
// Also, you should be tracking how many times they have guessed.
// Then, at the end, when you tell them that they guessed correctly,
// you should mention how many guesses it took them.
