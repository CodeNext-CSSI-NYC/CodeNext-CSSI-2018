// Use a for loop to simulate flipping a coin 100 times.
// Think carefully about how you could use Math.random() or random-int to do this.
// (There are several possible answers.)
// Keep track of how many of the flips are heads.
// Print out the total number of flips and the total number of heads at the end.
// How often is it exactly 50/100? Fun fact: this should only happen about 8% of the time.
